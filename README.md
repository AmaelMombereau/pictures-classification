## Project Description (English version)

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning Engineer program offered by OpenClassrooms.

It focuses on dog breed classification from images using deep learning techniques. The objective was to compare different computer vision models — both trained from scratch and through transfer learning — using the Stanford Dogs dataset, which contains 20,580 images across 120 dog breeds (each with 150–200 photos).

For the models built from scratch, we implemented:

An initial CNN model with preprocessing and optimizations (e.g., Batch Normalization)

Data augmentation techniques

Network improvements with deeper layers, double convolutional blocks, and Dropout regularization

We then experimented with two transfer learning models, ResNet50 and Xception, with and without hyperparameter tuning. The best-performing model, Xception, was integrated into a Streamlit demo app for visualization and testing.
